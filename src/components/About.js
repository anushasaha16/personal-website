                <h1>Hi, I'm Anusha</h1>
                <p>I'm a junior majoring in <strong>Computer Science</strong> at the <strong>University of Texas at Dallas</strong>. 
                I'm particularly interested in working with AI and machine learning. I'm currently an undergraduate research 
                assistant at the NeuroSpin Compute Laboratory at UTD where I focus on Skyrmion Reservoir Computing. 
                I'm also a project coordinator officer for the Artificial Intelligence Society student organization 
                at UTD where I help create technical workshops that promote various subfields of AI.
